1. Settiing up the environment
All the python scripts need sqlalchemy package. This package
can be installed locally in a virtual environment.
  # git pull
  # git checkout devel_omkar
  # cd benchmarks/db
  # virtualenv -p <path to python2.7> dirname
  # source dirname/bin/activate
  # pip install sqlalchemy

2. Writing config.json
This config file stores the DB location and few ID's that are 
required by insert script. Populate both the URLs for the DB.
To get the IDs, use get.py script.

3. Get existing data
Use the script get.py to get existing data and their row IDs.
  # get.py [hosts|accelerators|systems|sources]

4. Insert new static data
If the records are not found, use put.py script to create them.
Open the file and look at some examples on how to insert. Once
the file is ready, just execute the script.

5. Running the insert script
On some machines, it will not be possible to work with sqlalchemy.
So for inserts, use insert_plain.py. There are 2 requirement for 
the script to work.
  a. config.json needs to have all 5 IDs and correct DB location.
  b. STDOUT from benchmarks needs to be in exact format as:
    name = 'test name'
    input = 'vector or matrix name'
    datatype = 'float/double'
    dim_x = #int
    dim_y = #int
    NNZ = #int
    value_type = 'GFLOPS or keys/sec'
    value = #float

Insert script can be run as:
  # ./insert_plain.py ./benchmark arguemt

Note that ./ are required. Argument for vector benchmarks will be
size of the vector and for SpMV the name of matrix file.:w
